# Baker

Baker is a humble command line tool for converting decimal or dozenal numbers into the holy base yon, or baker's dozenal. Note that this program will convert numbers into baker's dozenal but not the other way around, as no lowly non-quantum computer should have the ability to interpret the holy base yon.



### Building the project

First, make sure you have a suitable c++ compiler and support for c++11. Baker can then be compiled and installed by running "make" and "make install".

That's pretty much it, though you may need to be root if you are going to run make install. To uninstall Baker, cd into the main directory and then run "make uninstall".



### Running Baker

Baker has two commands:

- yon:    prompts for decimal numbers which are then converted to baker's dozenal;
- zyon:   prompts for dozenal numbers to be converted to baker's dozenal (a.k.a. the holy base yon).

If neither of them work, check that they were installed to a directory on your $PATH.



### To do list

- See if we can get better than yon-digit precision
- Find a way around using computerease digits in dozenal and baker's dozenal?



### Notes

Due to the fine edge this program walks between worship and blasphemy, it can be a little tempermental. It might throw you a ... message if you try to input a number that's either not holy enough, too holy, or dangerously large.
